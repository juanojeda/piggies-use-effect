# UseEffects best practices, told through the 3 Little Pigs

This is an app that attempts to illustrate some of the best practices I outline in [my talk](./docs/talk.md), through a contrived example application.

Check out the talk, and/or look through the branches in the following order to see how the best practices come into play.

- Pt 1: [The base](https://github.com/juanojeda/piggies-use-effect/tree/pt-1-add-pigs)

**Why we want useEffects**
- Pt 2.1: [Fetching data - it doesn't work!](https://github.com/juanojeda/piggies-use-effect/tree/pt-2_1-fetch-materials-by-index)
- Pt 2.2: [Fetching data - it works, but it's not quite right](https://github.com/juanojeda/piggies-use-effect/tree/pt-2_2-fetch-materials-by-index-with-use-state)
- Pt 2.3: [Fetching data - it works, and it's got useEffect](https://github.com/juanojeda/piggies-use-effect/tree/pt-2_3-fetch-materials-by-index-with-use-effect)

**How to use useEffects effectively**
- Pt 3.1: [Multiple effects - it works but is hard to test](https://github.com/juanojeda/piggies-use-effect/tree/pt-3_1-wolf-success-monitor-overloaded-use-effect)
- Pt 3.2: [Multiple effects - still works, but easier to test](https://github.com/juanojeda/piggies-use-effect/tree/pt-3_2-wolf-success-monitor-multi-effect)

## How to run the app

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
